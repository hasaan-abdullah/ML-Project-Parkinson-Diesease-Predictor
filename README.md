Project: Parkinson's Disease Predictor: 
This machine learning project aims to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease in patients.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the "Parkinsons Dataset" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Link of data-set file: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/

Requirements:

Step 1 : 

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

Step 2 : Code

Template code is provided in the Parkinson's Diesease Machine Learning.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the included parkinsons.csv dataset file to complete your work. You will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. 

Step 3 : Run

In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the directory where your Jupyter Notebook file is located and click on the file to open it.

Once the notebook is open, make sure that the CSV data file is in the same directory as the notebook file. If the CSV data file is located in a different directory, you can use the appropriate file path to load the data into the notebook.

Use the notebook to run the code and analyze the data as needed.

Step 4 :

If you want to visualize your features on SVM linear and polynomial kernal, then you have to run the attached jupyter notebook file named as SVM visualization of linear and polynomial kernal.ipynb and for this you also need parkinsons.csv data file in the same folder or directory.
